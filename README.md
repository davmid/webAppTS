# ManagMe â€“ Modern Project and Task Management Platform

ManagMe is a modern, clean, and extensible web application designed to streamline project collaboration and task tracking. Inspired by platforms like Jira and Trello, it enables individual users or teams to manage projects, organize work into user stories, and assign tasks with customizable details.

The system is designed for scalability and built on modern technologies such as React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase (for authentication and database management).
